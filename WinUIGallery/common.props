    <!-- This file is similar to Directory.Build.props, in that it contains properties common to all WinUI Gallery projects.
         However, this props file is imported directly in the projects themselves,
         since Directory.Build.props is imported before some key MSBuild properties are set which we need here.  In general, common properties
         should go in Directory.Build.props instead of here, this just contains special cases. -->

    <!-- When building outside the WinUI repo, configure the NugetPackageDirectory property it normally sets.  This value is based
         off of the NuGetPackageRoot property set in the auto-generated NuGet props.  Unfortunately, the auto-generated props
         are imported after Directory.Build.props, so we can't assign it there -->
